ISSUE: CSS styles not loading properly - missing colors/sizes
STATUS: RESOLVED

ACTIONS TAKEN:
1. Removed Tailwind CDN script from all HTML files (CSP conflict)
2. Updated Tailwind config to include all HTML files
3. Added critical utility classes directly to src/styles.css
4. Rebuilt CSS with comprehensive color/size/utility classes

KEY FIXES:
- Fixed CSP blocking external Tailwind script
- Added primary color palette (text-primary-*, bg-primary-*)
- Added common utility classes (sizes, colors, spacing)
- Server now running on port 3000

CURRENT STATUS: 
- App loads with proper styling
- All Tailwind classes now included in CSS
- No CSP errors
