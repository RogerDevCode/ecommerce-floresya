# FloresYa E-commerce Platform - Project Checklist

## Project Overview
- [x] Enterprise-grade e-commerce platform for flower sales
- [x] Built with TypeScript in strict mode, Node.js, Express, Supabase PostgreSQL
- [x] Clean architecture principles with zero technical debt tolerance
- [x] Extensive use of atomic database transactions

## Architecture Setup
- [x] Directory structure implemented (src/app, controllers, services, config, types, utils, frontend)
- [x] Express server setup with FloresYaServer class
- [x] API route definitions in routes/
- [x] Express middleware (auth, security stack)
- [x] Service Layer Pattern: Business logic in service classes (ProductService, OrderService, etc.)
- [x] Thin controllers delegating to services

## Database Integration
- [x] Supabase configuration (client and service client)
- [x] Database types inlined in src/config/supabase.ts
- [x] Atomic transactions via PostgreSQL functions (create_order_with_items, update_order_status_with_history, etc.)
- [x] Schema compliance with supabase_schema.sql as single source of truth
- [x] Transaction functions deployed in Supabase

## TypeScript Configuration
- [x] Strict mode enabled, no 'any' types
- [x] ESNext modules with bundler resolution
- [x] Path mapping: @shared-types/* and @database-types/* aliases
- [x] Build target ES2022 with DOM types
- [x] Separate configs: tsconfig.json, tsconfig.prod.json, tsconfig.dev.json

## Code Quality
- [x] ESLint strict configuration
- [x] Type checking passes npm run type:check
- [x] Zero technical debt: no stubs, commented code, or temporary fixes
- [x] Comprehensive error handling with logging

## Frontend Architecture
- [x] Vanilla TypeScript, no framework dependencies
- [x] Module compilation to dist/ served via Express
- [x] Bootstrap 5 for UI components
- [x] API communication via src/frontend/services/api.ts

## Authentication & Security
- [x] JWT authentication middleware
- [x] UserService handles authentication logic
- [x] Roles: admin, user, support with RBAC
- [x] Security middleware: Helmet, CORS, rate limiting, body parsing, compression

## API Documentation
- [x] Swagger/OpenAPI at /api-docs
- [x] JSON spec at /api-docs.json
- [x] Configuration in src/config/swagger.ts
- [x] Health check endpoint /api/health

## Environment & Deployment
- [x] Environment variables configured (SUPABASE_URL, keys, JWT_SECRET, etc.)
- [x] Vercel deployment with api/index.ts serverless handler
- [x] Static files served from public/
- [x] Build command npm run build
- [x] Production URL live and operational

## Testing Strategy
- [x] Vitest test runner configured
- [x] Supertest for API endpoint testing
- [x] Coverage reports available
- [x] Focus on API, services, transactions, validation

## Performance & Optimization
- [x] Static file serving with 1-year cache in production
- [x] Prepared statements for all queries
- [x] Connection pooling via Supabase
- [x] Transaction batching for related operations
- [x] Response compression enabled

## Key Features Implementation
- [x] Product catalog with images
- [x] Shopping cart functionality
- [x] Order management
- [x] User authentication
- [x] Admin panel with image management
- [x] Payment processing

- [x] Sorting functionality (name, image_count)
- [x] Modal links for editing images
- [x] TypeScript type consistency
- [x] Error handling and logging for image operations

## Quality Assurance
- [x] All TypeScript compilation errors resolved (0 errors)
- [x] ESLint warnings reduced to acceptable levels
- [x] Strict typing enforced across all files
